"Comparison of Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages (EWMA) for time series analysis."


Moving Average Analysis – SMA vs. EWMA
This project provides an in-depth analysis of Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages (EWMA) for time series data smoothing and trend analysis. The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in analyzing real-world datasets and their impact on forecasting accuracy.

Introduction
Moving averages are essential techniques in time series analysis that help smooth fluctuations and identify trends. This repository compares:

Simple Moving Average (SMA): A straightforward approach that calculates the average of data points over a fixed window.
Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA): A more sophisticated method that assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations, making it more responsive to recent changes.
Features
Implementation and comparison of SMA and EWMA techniques.
Visualization of moving averages on real-world data.
Step-by-step explanations of the concepts with Python code.
Interactive Jupyter Notebook for experimentation.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy – Numerical computing.
Matplotlib – Data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook – Interactive coding environment.
